            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <p>
                    GRNsight is a web application for visualizing models of small- to medium-scale gene regulatory networks (GRNs). GRNsight was created to work with the input and output spreadsheets used by <a href="http://kdahlquist.github.io/GRNmap/index.html" target="blank">GRNmap</a>, a MATLAB program that estimates the parameters and performs forward simulations of a differential equations model of a GRN.  However, GRNsight can be used to visualize any medium-scale GRN that is specified by the appropriate spreadsheet format.  GRNsight is best-suited for visualizing networks of fewer than 35 genes (nodes) and 70 regulatory relationships (edges), but can display networks of up to 75 nodes and 150 edges. The following sections describe how to use GRNsight.

                <p>
                    GRNsight has been tested with and confirmed to be working in Chrome version 43.0.2357.65 or higher and Firefox version 38.0.1 or higher on Windows 7 and Mac OS X operating systems. It may not work with other browsers, versions, or operating systems.

                                        If you have a Microsoft Excel Workbook file (*.xlsx) that was used as an input or generated as an output by the MATLAB program <a href="http://kdahlquist.github.io/GRNmap/index.html" target="blank">GRNmap</a>, you do not need to perform any further modifications to use the Workbook with GRNsight.  You can move on to <a class="showSection2">Section 2</a> to learn how to load your file as an input spreadsheet.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If you do not have your own input spreadsheet, you can load and view demonstration gene regulatory networks. Selecting the menu item Demo > Demo #1: Unweighted GRN (21 genes, 50 edges) or Demo #3: Unweighted GRN (21 genes, 31 edges) will load a network graph with black edges and regular (pointy) arrowheads. Selecting the menu item Demo > Demo #2: Weighted GRN (21 genes, 50 edges, Dahlquist Lab unpublished data) or Demo #4: Weighted GRN (21 genes, 31 edges, Schade et al. 2004 data) will load a network graph with colored edges of varying thicknesses. See <a class="showSection3">Section 3</a> for details on how GRNsight displays the graph.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If you want to create manually a new file to use with GRNsight, format the file in the following manner:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                GRNsight will only accept Microsoft Excel Workbook (*.xlsx) files.  Note that Excel 97-2003 Workbook (*.xls) files are not able to be read by GRNsight, nor are any other file formats (*.txt, *.csv, etc.)
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                GRNsight reads gene regulatory network information that is in the form of an adjacency matrix to generate the nodes and edges of the graph.
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        There must be one worksheet in your Excel Workbook entitled “network” or “network_optimized_weights”. Generally, the “network” worksheet describes an unweighted network and the “network_optimized_weights” worksheet describes a weighted network.  If the Workbook contains worksheets with both names, the display of the “network_optimized_weights” data will take precedence.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        In the “network” and “network_optimized_weights” worksheets, the upper-left cell (A1) should contain the text “rows genes affected/cols genes controlling”.  This text is there as a reminder of the direction of the regulatory relationships specified by the adjacency matrix.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        The rest of the first row should contain the names of the transcription factors that are controlling the other genes in the network, one transcription factor name per column. Transcription factor names must be unique for each column and must be 12 characters or fewer.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        The rest of the first column should contain the names of the target genes that are being controlled by the transcription factors heading each of the columns in the matrix, one target gene name per row. Transcription factor names must be unique for each row and must be 12 characters or fewer.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        GRNsight is primarily designed to depict gene regulatory networks that contain just transcription factors and that can be represented by a symmetric adjacency matrix. However, starting with version 1.8, GRNsight allows the user to upload spreadsheets with asymmetric adjacency matrices.  I.e., the number, identity, and order of genes across the top and side of the adjacency matrix do not have to match.  A gene name at the top of the matrix will be considered the same as a gene name on the side if it contains the same text string, regardless of capitalization.  For example, “ABF1”, “Abf1”, and “abf1” would all be considered the same gene, but “ABF 1” or “ABF-1” would not be considered the same as “ABF1”.  GRNsight is case-preserving in that it will keep the capitalization that the user originally entered into the spreadsheet. The gene name capitalization occurring across the top takes precedence over the gene name capitalization occurring on the side of the adjacency matrix for display of the gene names on the nodes of the graph.  The nodes that display on the graph are automatically sized to accommodate the size of the label. Labels are restricted to 12 characters; use shorter gene symbols for nodes so that the node boxes do not get too large.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        For unweighted networks in the “network” worksheet, each cell in the matrix should then contain a zero (0) if there is no regulatory relationship between those two transcription factors, or a one (1) if there is a regulatory relationship between them.  In the screenshot below, the “1” in cell E6 means that FHL1 regulates FKH2.  The “1” in cell C3 means that AFT1 regulates itself.  When this file is loaded into GRNsight, it will generate a graph with 21 nodes, one for each transcription factor, and 50 edges, for each of the cells that contain a “1” in this adjacency matrix.  The edges will be black with regular (pointy) arrowheads. The demonstration file <a href="https://github.com/dondi/GRNsight/raw/master/test-files/demo-files/21-genes_50-edges_Dahlquist-data_input.xlsx">"Demo #1: Unweighted GRN"</a> corresponds to the adjacency matrix shown below.

                                                        When GRNsight encounters a worksheet entitled “network” with all 1’s and 0’s specifying an adjacency matrix, it will automatically color the edges black and put regular (pointy) arrowheads on the edges. However, GRNsight can also be used to display weighted edges with varying thicknesses and colors based on the magnitude and sign of the weights, respectively. To generate this type of adjacency matrix by hand, create a worksheet called “network_optimized_weights”. Instead of using 1’s to indicate connections in the network, use values that are real numbers > 0 to indicate an activation relationship or &lt; 0 to indicate a repression relationship. The screenshot below gives an example of this type of adjacency matrix. The demonstration file <a href="https://github.com/dondi/GRNsight/raw/master/test-files/demo-files/21-genes_50-edges_Dahlquist-data_estimation_output.xlsx">Demo #2: Weighted GRN"</a> corresponds to the adjacency matrix shown below. For the weighted edges to display with different colors and thicknesses, make sure that you have selected the menu item Edit > Preferences > Format edges based on optimized weight parameters. For more information on how GRNsight displays weighted edges on the graph, see <a class="showSection3">Section 3</a> below.

                                                        Note that GRNsight is designed to visualize “small-scale” or “medium-scale” gene regulatory networks, not the entire gene regulatory network for an organism. Currently, it is recommended that you upload networks with no more than 35 unique genes or 70 edges. If you upload a network with 50 nodes or 100 edges or more, you will receive a warning and the network graph will still display.  If you attempt to upload a network of 75 or more nodes or 100 or more edges, the graph will not display.

                                    <li>GRNsight graphs are generated through D3.js, a JavaScript data visualization library.  We have modified the default implementation of D3 to include the following features:
                                    </li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Nodes are rectangular.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                The labels on the nodes are what is found in your “network” or “network_optimized_weights” worksheet, depending on whether you are displaying an unweighted or weighted graph.  GRNsight is <i>case-preserving</i> in that it will keep the capitalization that the user originally entered into the spreadsheet.  The gene name capitalization occurring across the top takes precedence over the gene name capitalization occurring on the side of the adjacency matrix for display of the gene names on the nodes of the graph.

                                                The nodes are automatically sized to accommodate the size of the label. Labels are restricted to 12 characters; use shorter gene symbols for nodes so that the node boxes do not get too large.

                                                The edges are arcs instead of straight lines.  Self-regulatory edges are indicated by a loop on the lower-right side of a node.

                                                If your adjacency matrix is contained in a worksheet entitled “network” and contains just 1's and 0's, GRNsight will make the edges connecting nodes black with a regular (pointy) arrowhead originating from the transcription factor (columns) to the target gene (rows) in your matrix. (Note that selecting the menu item Edit > Preferences > Default to black edges with regular arrowheads will make the graph display as an unweighted graph even if the worksheet "network_optimized_weights" has real numbers instead of 1's to indicated weighted edges.)

                                                If your adjacency matrix is contained in a worksheet entitled “network_optimized_weights” and contains real numbers instead of just 1’s to indicate weighted connections, it will adjust the arrowhead type, thickness, and color of the edges as follows:
                                            </li>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        For positive weights > 0, the edge will be given a regular (pointy) arrowhead to indicate an activation relationship between the two nodes.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        For negative weights &lt; 0, the edge will be given a blunt arrowhead (a line segment perpendicular to the edge direction) to indicate a repression relationship between the two nodes.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        The thickness of the edge will vary based on the magnitude of the absolute value of the weight.  Larger magnitudes will have thicker edges and smaller magnitudes will have thinner edges.  The way that GRNsight determines the edge thickness is as follows.  GRNsight divides all weight values by the absolute value of the maximum weight in the matrix to normalize all the values to between zero and 1.  GRNsight then adjusts the thickness of the lines to vary continuously from the minimum thickness (for normalized weights near zero) to maximum thickness (normalized weights of 1).
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        The color of the edge also imparts information about the regulatory relationship. Edges with positive normalized weight values from 0.05 to 1 are colored magenta; edges with negative normalized weight values from -0.05 to -1 are colored cyan. Edges with normalized weight values between -0.05 and 0.05 are colored grey to emphasize that their normalized magnitude is near zero and that they have a weak influence on the target gene.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        For the weighted edges to display with different colors and thickness, make sure that you have selected the menu item Edit > Preferences > Format edges based on optimized weight parameters. Selecting the menu item Edit > Preferences > Default to black edges with regular arrowheads will make the graph display as an unweighted graph even if the worksheet "network_optimized_weights" has real numbers instead of 1's to indicated weighted edges.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        If you hover your mouse over an edge on the graph, a tooltip will display the weight value to four significant digits.
                                                    </li>
                                                </ul>

                                                Once you have selected the spreadsheet file to be loaded, GRNsight automatically lays out the positions of the nodes and edges based on certain Force Graph Parameters.
                                            </li>

                                                        <span style="font-weight: bold">Link Distance</span> determines the minimum distance maintained between nodes, i.e., it changes the length of the edges. Smaller numbers specify shorter lengths, larger numbers specify longer lengths. The range of values for this parameter are 1 to 1000 with a default value of 500.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>

A more negative value causes more repulsion between nodes. The range of values for this parameter are -2000 to 0 with a default value of -1000.
                                                    </li>

The larger the number, the larger the size of the charged area around a node that repels other nodes. The range of values for this parameter is 0 to 2000 with a default value of 1000.
                                                    </li>

It varies from 0 (no force) to 1 (maximum force holding the nodes in the center). The default value of this parameter is 0.10.

Unchecking the box unlocks the sliders again. Alternately, you can select the menu item Format > Lock Force Graph Parameters to lock the current settings. A check mark will appear next to the menu item to indicate that they are locked. Selecting the menu item Format > Lock Force Graph Parameters a second time will unlock the sliders again.

                                                You have the option of manually moving nodes on the graph. Left-click on a node, and with the mouse button depressed, move the node to any position within the graph bounding box. Release the mouse button to leave the node in that position. Once a node has been moved, it will no longer respond to changes in the Force Graph Parameters. To restore the node's responsiveness to the Force Graph Parameters, double-click on the node.

                                                Note that GRNsight is designed to visualize “medium-scale” gene regulatory networks, not the entire gene regulatory network for an organism.  Currently, the bounding box for display of the graph has a fixed size.  Adjacency matrices with a large number of nodes or edges may not load, or if they do, may just look like “spaghetti”.

                                        To print a graph, select the menu item File > Print. Mac users can utilize the native print to PDF function available from their operating system to print the graph to a PDF file. Windows users will need to have the full version of Adobe Acrobat (or other "print to PDF" utility) to print graphs to a PDF file. The Print menu item is disabled until a gene regulatory network graph is loaded. There is a known bug when GRNsight is used with Firefox browsers where the side of the graph gets cut off. This is an issue with Firefox that we cannot solve at this time. There are two workarounds. First, in Firefox, go to the menu item File > Page Setup and check the box Shrink to fit Page Width. Second, you can use the Chrome browser to print to PDF.

This section describes how to interpret the results of the resulting gene regulatory network graph biologically, focusing on the demonstration files Demo #3: Unweighted GRN (21 genes, 31 edges) and Demo #4: Weighted GRN (21 genes, 31 edges, Schade et al. 2004 data).  These two files correspond to supplementary data published in the paper, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-015-0092-6" target="blank">Dahlquist, K.D., Fitzpatrick, B.G., Camacho, E.T., Entzminger, S.D., and Wanner, N.C. (2015) Parameter Estimation for Gene Regulatory Networks from Microarray Data: Cold Shock Response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology. 77: 1457-1492, published online 29 September 2015, DOI: 10.1007/s11538-015-0092-6</a>, and when displayed by GRNsight, represent interactive versions of Figures 1 and 8 of that paper respectively.

                                            The figures shown below give a side-by-side view of the same adjacency matrices laid out by GRNsight and by hand.  The top three figures are derived from Demo #3: Unweighted GRN (21 genes, 31 edges), and the bottom three panels are derived from Demo #4: Weighted GRN (21 genes, 31 edges, Schade et al. 2004 data).  The left two panels show an example of the automatic layout performed by GRNsight.  The right two panels show the same adjacency matrix laid out by hand in Adobe Illustrator, corresponding to Figure 1 (top right) and Figure 8 (bottom right) of the <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-015-0092-6" target="blank">Dahlquist et al. (2015)</a> paper. The middle two panels started with the automatic layout from GRNsight and then were manually manipulated from within GRNsight to lay them out similarly to the right-hand panels.  The use of GRNsight represents a substantial time savings compared to creating the same figure entirely by hand.

                                            Viewing the unweighted network (top panel) allows one to make observations about the network structure.  For example, YAP6 has the highest in-degree, being regulated by six other transcription factors.  RAP1 has an out-degree of five, regulating four other transcription factors and itself.  Four genes, AFT1, NRG1, RAP1, and YAP6, regulate themselves.  Many of the transcription factors are involved in regulatory chains, with the longest including five nodes originating at SKN7.  There are several other 4-node chains that originate at CIN5, MAC1, PHD1, SKN7, and YAP1. Finally, there are two feedforward motifs involving CIN5, ROX1, and YAP6 and SKN7, YAP1, and ROX1.  More information about this network can be found in Dahlquist et al. (2015).

                                            The networks with colored edges shown in the bottom panel display the results of a mathematical model, called GRNmap, where the expression levels of the individual transcription factors were modeled using mass balance ordinary differential equations with a sigmoidal production function. Each equation in the model included a production rate, a degradation rate, weights that denote the magnitude and type of influence of the connected transcription factors (activation or repression), and a threshold of expression. The differential equation model was fit to published yeast cold shock microarray data from Schade et al. (2004) using a penalized nonlinear least squares approach. Model predictions fit the experimental data well, within the 95% confidence interval.

                                            In particular, GRNsight is displaying the results of the weight parameters.  Positive weights > 0 represent an activation relationship and are shown by regular (pointy) arrowheads.  One example is that CIN5 activates the expression of MSN1.  Negative weights < 0 represent a repression relationship and are shown by a blunt arrowhead (a line segment perpendicular to the edge direction).  One example is that ABF1 represses the expression of MSN1.

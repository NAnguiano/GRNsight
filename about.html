                    GRNsight is an open source web application for visualizing models of medium-scale gene regulatory networks. GRNsight is a joint project of the <a href='http://www.lmu.edu/' target='_blank'>Loyola Marymount University</a> Bioinformatics and Biomathematics Groups, headed by Dr. Kam Dahlquist, Dr. John David N. Dionisio, and Dr. Ben G. Fitzpatrick.  Several undergraduate students initiated the development of GRNsight in Spring 2014, including Britain Southwick (Computer Science, ’14), Katrina Sherbina (Biomathematics, ’14) and Nicole Anguiano (Computer Science, ’16).  At present, Nicole Anguiano is continuing development on the project.
                    <br><br>
                    A <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_regulatory_network' target='_blank'>gene regulatory network (GRN)</a> consists of genes, transcription factors, and the regulatory connections between them, which govern the level of expression of mRNA and protein from those genes. GRNs can be mathematically modeled and simulated by applications such as GRNmap, a MATLAB program that estimates the parameters and performs forward simulations of a differential equations model of a GRN. Computer representations of GRNs, such as the models output by GRNmap, are in the form of a tabular spreadsheet (adjacency matrix) that is not easily interpretable. Ideally, GRNs should be displayed as diagrams (graphs) detailing the regulatory relationships (edges) between each gene (node) in the network. To address this need, we developed GRNsight.
                    <br><br>
                    GRNsight allows users to upload spreadsheets generated by GRNmap and uses the information in these spreadsheets to automatically create and display a graph of the GRN model. The application colors the edges and adjusts their thickness based on the sign (activation or repression) and the strength (magnitude) of the regulatory relationship, respectively. Finally, GRNsight then allows the user to modify the graph in order to define the best visual layout for the network. Most of GRNsight is written in JavaScript. HTTP requests are handled using <a href='http://nodejs.org/' target='_blank'>Node.js</a> and the <a href='http://expressjs.com/' target='_blank'>Express framework</a>. Graphs are generated through <a href='http://d3js.org/' target='_blank'>D3.js</a>, a JavaScript data visualization library.

                <p id='releaseNotes'>Release Notes</p>
                GRNsight v1.2
                <ul>
                    <li>Branched code so that the stable v1.0 runs on the GRNsight home page, while v1.1 Beta runs on a new Beta page for live testing of new features.</li>
                    <li> Improvements were made to the user interface layout:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A menu bar was implemented to organize GRNsight functions and options.</li>
                            <li>Instead of multiple “Open” and “Submit” buttons, the “Open” menu option opens a dialog from which to choose a GRNmap spreadsheet and then automatically loads the graph; a reload option was also implemented.</li>
                            <li>Information about each force graph parameter was added into a tooltip that appears upon hovering over the label.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The thickness of the edges was changed to be assigned on a continuous linear scale instead of using the four quartiles. Edges that have a normalized weight parameter of 0.05 or less were colored gray. The thickness of the edge was changed to be based on the magnitude of the absolute value of the weight. Larger magnitudes have thicker edges and smaller magnitudes have thinner edges. The way that GRNsight determines the edge thickness is as follows.  GRNsight divides all weight values by the absolute value of the maximum weight in the matrix to normalize all the values to between zero and 1.  GRNsight then adjusts the thickness of the lines to vary continuously from the minimum thickness (for normalized weights near zero) to maximum thickness (weights of 1). Edges with a normalized value of 0.05 or less are colored gray.</li>
                    <li>Improvements were made to the appearance of the triangular arrowheads, blunt arrowheads, and circular edges. The triangular arrowheads and blunt arrowheads were also changed to be assigned on the same continuous linear scale as the edges.</li>
                    <li>Cosmetic issues and performance issues were fixed by temporarily removing the highlighting and outlining of edges.</li>
                    <li>grnsight.cs.lmu.edu was configured to serve 4 services via standard ports to reduce likelihood of blockage by anti-malware software.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                GRNsight v1.0
                <ul>
                    <li>GRNsight has a service-oriented architecture.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>GRNsight has two pieces: a server and a web client.</li>
                            <li>The server is responsible for receiving and parsing an Excel spreadsheet uploaded by the user.</li>
                            <li>The server uses the <a href='http://nodejs.org/' target='_blank'>Node.js</a> framework.</li>
                            <li>The web client receives data from the server and generates the graph visualization.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>GRNsight uses the <a href='http://d3js.org/' target='_blank'>Data-Driven Documents (D3)</a> JavaScript library to generate a graph derived from input network data. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>D3 dynamically manipulates HTML and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to form the elements of the graph.</li>
                            <li>GRNsight implements D3’s force layout, which applies a physics-based simulation to the graph.</li>
                            <li>D3 also allows for the fine tuning of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), the code that styles web pages.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The default implementation of D3 simply had nodes and edges. We added several features, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rectangular nodes.</li>
                            <li>Labels on nodes.</li>
                            <li>Variant node size.</li>
                            <li>Multiple arrowheads were created as to represent the different types of edges depicted by the graph (activation, repression, and self-regulation).</li>
                            <li>A special case was added to add a looping edge if a node regulated itself.</li>
                            <li>Edge thickness varies based on the weight parameters in the spreadsheet uploaded by the user. Four thicknesses are set based on the four quartiles of the range of the weight parameter values.</li>
                            <li>Edge color is based on the sign of the weight parameter.  Positive values are colored magenta and negative values are colored cyan.  Values in the first quartile near zero are colored gray.</li>
                            <li>Tooltips display the weight value of an edge upon mouse hover; four significant digits are displayed.</li>
                            <li>Edges were given a white outline to better distinguish them when multiple edges overlapped.</li>
                            <li>The user can drag nodes to customize their view of the network.</li>
                            <li>Edges adapt their anchor points to the movements of the nodes. </li>
                            <li>Dragging a node will highlight all adjacent edges.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The user interface is compatible with Firefox and Chrome browsers.
                        <ul>
                            <li>File upload is via a simple HTML form element.</li>
                            <li>Nodes are displayed as interactive HTML elements.</li>
                            <li>Advanced users can utilize force graph parameter setting sliders to refine the visualization.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Nodes have a charge, which repels or attracts other nodes.</li>
                                    <li>The charge distance determines at what range a node’s charge will affect other nodes.</li>
                                    <li>The link distance determines the minimum distance maintained between nodes.</li>
                                    <li>Gravity determines how strongly the nodes are drawn to the center of the graph.</li>
                                    <li>Sliders can be locked to prevent changes.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
